# Instructions for developers
You can either work on the Javascript code directly or work on the coffeescript. For installation and compilation instructions please have a look @ [coffeescript website](coffeescript.org). Same holds for the css/less code @ [less website](http://lesscss.org/).

When including icons make sure their height is 100 px.
