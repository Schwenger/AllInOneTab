# THE new tab page you always wanted 
First off - congratulations: You have found it. THE new tab page. Well, unless you have no weekly schedule or hate shortcuts. In these cases, you have to continue your search.

## Shortcuts
Otherwise, have fun with this handy tool allowing you to place shortcuts to your favorite and most frequently used pages, such as youtube, facebook, or github.

You can customize the shortcuts to your very own needs. The only thing you need is an appropriate image. That's it.

## Timetable
Using the sidebar you can switch to the timetable display. Here, you can display your timetable, optional with the lecturer's name (or whoever is leading this meeting), and a room. Choose a color for the lecture and - if you want - include a link to the lecture's homepage.

## Radio integration
Right now, there is fairly limited support to this feature, but if you're German or enjoy listening to German people, you can start a live stream to the "SWR 3" Station (South-West-Radio 3) with one click - provided you have my SWR3 extension installed (available on github). More support will be integrated if requested.

## Translation
One more feature for German speaking people or English speaking people learning German: just press 't' to open a query panel for a German <-> English translation. Type in your query and press enter - voil√†! Alternatively, you can click the bottommost button on the sidebar to open the panel.

# Instruction for users
Due to a lack of user interface you have to provide your data directly in the model.coffee file. There is a default provided, so you can just play the copycat and adapt appropriately. I have faith in you, you can do it!

Afterwards, make sure to run the merge.sh script to apply your changes.

# Instructions for developers
You can either work on the javascript code directly or work on the coffeescript. For installation and compilation instructions please have a look @ [coffeescript website](coffeescript.org). Same holds for the css/less code @ [less website](http://lesscss.org/).

When including icons make sure their height is 100 px and their width is appropriate.
